    In the end, it still didn't slow down. We walk too fast to see the scenery around us, and we don't have time to think about what we are chasing and what kind of life we want. We just move forward blindly. The plans that were made before are all rotten. I haven't opened the book again, I have never insisted on fitness, I want to learn a lot, but I haven't acted. All desires are washed away by busyness, it seems that hard work but inaction, it is really sad. Have you decided to change? Are you willing to live an indifferent life? Are you willing to give up chasing material life and enjoy spiritual life? If you want, then act and do what you want to do. Don't be afraid of failure, because the meaning of life lies in the process in which you participate. In this process, you can use what you have learned to help others or help yourself. This is the value you create, unparalleled.

    Yesterday, my friend and I visit the Great Wall. It's a rainy day which we cannot consider it. Of course, terrible, we all wetted! But the sense looks nice and the guys touched me, however I dont know anything about him, just some words. Karma? Maybe! I really hope I can see him again. That's all~

    Huh~ Times gone, long time no see. Recently I focus on my job hunting and it's tough enough, I'm always online, looking for a good job which I satisfied money and work. But honestly, it's hard to me to find a proper one. I never give up and keep going. Today, I will go to Beijing to take some interviews, bless myself and good luck~

    With one moment, I'm recognized I only have a little skills of backend with shallow tech stack. That's terriable, I should expand it for example learning some frontend tech points. Language just a tool, right? We should try it over again with your unvalidated ideas. The spirit of OpenSource also so. Just do it.

    Have a bad headache and wake up just now... And I remember my uncle's words, he said "Everything looks meanfulless, I don't know, I just feel tired!". I don't know, I cannot give some useful advices, but life was going on, we cannot stop it! Later I'll try to talk to him about his situation, I hope everyone should be happy.

    The things I think right cannot follow my intention anyway. Yes, my paper was rejected. But this is not the one I want to express, this stuff cannot take me down. And I know everything will be ok, so smile it, don't be sad. As well as I'm so happy stay with you, the uncle who like my father care about me or much more than my father. That's my honor. I should be happy. Garacias!

    I like coding, I like that feel which part I enjoyed, instead of coding at company supervised by others. That beyond my intention, fake ones.

    I was really stupid when I was learning something new, whether I knew it before. Too ignorant, for knowledge, for human being!

    I'm sure C++ is good enough, and now I like it more than before. Why would I say that? I think that one reason is C++ have some advanced features I don't know before, that's attract me. Good job.
